    "Imagine you want to go river fishing and you are given a fishing rod. You don't have any fish or any fishing skills. You can't afford to learn fishing from some expert right now. So All you can do is to cast your fishing rod and wait for the results. So after some waiting you might think of going some where alongside the river where the water is deeper and thus number of fishes in that area is more. so you have a bigger chance of getting any. By catching the first fish you find out that going to noted areas isn't such a bad idea. so by waiting long times in **bad** places to fish (negative reward usually small amount for each time step), you learn to stop fishing in those areas, and by catching fish in **good** places (usually a terminal state with high reward), you try to find what is good about this place (in out example the depth of the river).

    "## RL vs MDP\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous doc we saw that in MDP we want to find the optimal actions in a world which by doing those actions we may reach the maximum sum of rewards over time. The main difference between MDP and RL is that in RL we are unaware of R(s,a,s') and T(s,a,s') and we must actually **do the action** to get the reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can assume MDP is an offline method because we already know what are T and R. but in RL we have to actually **do** some actions. therefor it is an online method."
