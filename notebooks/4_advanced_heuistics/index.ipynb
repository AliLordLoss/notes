This function is one of the search criteria for selecting estimates of the cost of the route so that it succeeds in reaching the nearest goal. The better heuristic function is, the fewer mistakes we make and the faster we get the answer. The most common way that transfers problem information to a search operation is called a heuristic function, usually denoted by h (n). \n",

    "        In general, admissible heuristic functions represent the cost of exact solutions to simplified or relaxed versions of the original problem (Pearl, 1984). For example, in a sliding tile puzzle (like 8-puzzle), to move a tile from position x to position y, x and y must be adjacent, and position y must be empty. By ignoring the empty constraint, we get a simplified problem where any tile can move to any adjacent position. We can solve any instance of this new problem optimally by moving each tile along the shortest path to its goal position, counting the number of moves made. The cost of such a solution is exactly the Manhattan distance from the initial state to the goal state. Since we removed a constraint on the moves, any solution to the original problem is also a solution to the simplified problem, and the cost of an optimal solution to the simplified problem is a lower bound on the cost of an optimal solution to the original problem. Thus, any heuristic derived in this way is admissible. \n",
